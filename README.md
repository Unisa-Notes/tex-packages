# Kayzels Tex Packages

This repo contains LaTeX packages that define custom styles and commands that can be used
when writing notes in LaTeX, or an assignment.

## Usage
There are two ways to use these files:
1. Add them directly to the project directory that contains the `tex` files being worked on.
   This requires importing them in a slightly different way â€” the normal way works,
   but sometimes it will complain on compiling.
   ```tex
   \usepackage{./notestyles}
   ```
2. Add them to your `texmf` directory.
   On Windows, using MiKTex, you can add a custom directory to your `texmf` root directories,
   by opening `MiKTex Console > Settings > Directories`, and then adding a path there.
   I recommend making a directory at `~\texmf`, set with `Generic` purposes.
   Inside that directory, the path needs to be `tex\latex\custom`, but `custom` can be replaced
   with whatever name you want to give the folder.
   After that, they can be imported into a LaTeX file as
   ```tex
   \usepackage{notestyles}
   ```
   Adding the files to your `texmf` directory has the added benefit of allowing LSPs such as [texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab),
   and tools such as [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) (if you use Vim or Neovim),
   to find the added commands and environments, which aids in autocomplete.
